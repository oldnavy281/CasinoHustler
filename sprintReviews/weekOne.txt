SPRINT REVIEW:
We still need to connect the front end and the back end. 
We've got the front end JS done and are currently working on the backend JS. 
Rachael and Hailey both are working on the front end and they've completed the major features for a basic game. Buttons that
work in order to play a basic game.
Quinton was/is working on the graphics of the game. They're finished but they were sent over incorrectly and He needs to resend them, They'll be added
on 11/20/2021. 
Chandler is working on the back end and making sure everything works correctly. (Quinton will help with that once graphics are done).
